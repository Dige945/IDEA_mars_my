        "description": "The vehicle is a white sedan that can be seen in profile. While it's clear that there's a \"4S store\" logo on its side, which suggests some sort of connection to automotive services, details like the exact make/model aren't discernible due to poor lighting conditions. Additionally, while one might assume that headlights would be illuminated during nighttime driving, they appear to be turned off - this could suggest either very early mornings or quite evenings when visibility isn't as critical for drivers."
